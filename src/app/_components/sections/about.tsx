        <p className='mb-3'>My programming adventure started when I was 14 and I got my first laptop. I had only one wish: playing Minecraft. I was not able to buy myself a copy of the game, but lucky for me, I saw a post on the Minecraft forum website that stated that Minecraft modders that post their mods on said forum get a chance to acquire a copy of the game as a gift.<br />

        <p className='mb-3'>
            Right thereafter, I started studying at a technical gymnasium with selective courses in programming. After graduating high school and having moderate success within the Minecraft modding scene, I found programming to be my passion. I enjoy problem-solving using computers and math. I'm in love with creating new and useful solutions to problems I encounter on a day-to-day basis.<br />
        <span className='italic border border-black rounded-full px-4 py-1'>Exploring the realm of computer science and techonlogy is my lifelong dream!</span></p>
